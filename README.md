Welcome to my repository showcasing the Unity projects I developed during my ARAtronics internship. This collection highlights a range of projects demonstrating different aspects of Unity development and integration with other technologies. Here’s an overview of what you’ll find:

## Projects

### Pong Game
A classic Pong game implemented in Unity, capturing the essence of this timeless arcade game.

### Servo Controller
A project that demonstrates how Unity can send signals to an ESP32 microcontroller to control a servo motor. This showcases integration between Unity and hardware.

### Scene Switching
An implementation that allows for dynamic scene transitions in Unity, triggered by specific actions in the initial scene. This project highlights event-driven scene management.

### Lego Builder
A fun Lego-building game where STL Lego files are utilized to create a gameplay experience involving dropping and assembling Lego pieces.

### Spider Simulation
A simulation project that uses an assembly from SolidWorks to create a spider model. The movement of the spider’s legs is animated using Unity scripts and hinge joints, demonstrating complex mechanical simulations.
